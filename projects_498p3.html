							<h3>About:</h3>
							<p>
								This was the final project in my Extended Reality and Society class. It required teams of four or five to spend four weeks developing an XR experience that is marketable,
								technically advanced, and has a social impact. Past projects have included AR apps to aid in rehab, educational VR experiences, and workout aides. My group opted to make a 
								VR fitness experience that teaches boxing skills in a fantasy-style video game. Our largest inspiration was Beat Saber, though we opted to focus on recognizing good boxing form
								rather than on matching movements to the beats of a song.

								The large majority of my work on this project was on the menu and UI system. I created the pop-ups that the user uses to interact with the game through the main
								menu, pause menu, calibration, and tutorial messages. It was very interesting to experience how different the UI creation workflow is in VR compared to traditional
								applications. I also implemented a system which tracks how many times the player has successfully deflected or dodged the enemy's attacks and how many times the player is
								hit by said attacks. These statistics are agregated in the pause menu and used to calculate an estimate for the player's calories burned in the level.

							<h3>Technology and Tools Used:</h3>
							<p>
								This project was created in Unreal using its VR template coded using the built in Unreal Blueprint editor. For project
								management, we utilized Atlassian's Jira software, specifically its story point system. Version control was mantained through GitHub. Additionally, this project
								required the use of assets whose creation is beyond the scope of the class. Most models were obtained from Sketchfab, textures from ambient.GG, and sounds from Pixabay.
