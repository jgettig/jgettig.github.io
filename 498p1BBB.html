        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
            This project involved loosely recreating the room 1695 BBB in Unreal engine to be experienced in VR. The experience includes multiple different
            interactable elements of the environment as well as a custom mechanic where the player can build LEGO in a room at the back of the space.

        <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
        <p>Work was done in collaboration with <a href="https://zeeelin.github.io/">Zelin Chen</a>.</p>
        <p> 
            I worked primarily on scripts that were not related to our game's 'affordance system,' which concerns allowing players to point at objects in the
            environment and press a button on their remote to cause some effect. As such, I worked on creating more back-end and timing-based scripts. These included
            the skeleton who hops around outside the building, the script that connects the light switches to the lights in the room and allows them to be toggled, the
            day/night system, the script that made NPCs look at the player, the script that makes one light flicker randomly, the script that causes lights to flash when 
            the fire alarm is pulled, and the scripts driving our custom LEGO interaction. Additionally, one affordance script I did do significant work on was the whiteboard
            script.
            <br><br>
            Beyond scripting, I helped with some of the broad level design by blocking out some of the room, creating the windows, and finding 3D models and sounds online.

        <h3>Technology/Tools Used:</h3>
        <p>
            This project created in Unreal using its VR template, and was coded using the built in Unreal Blueprint editor. This was our first ever project in Unreal. For project
            management, we utilized Atlassian's Jira software, specifically its story point system. Version control was mantained through GitHub. Additionally, this project
            required the use of assets whose creation is beyond the scope of the class. Most models were obtained from Sketchfab, textures from ambient.GG, and sounds from Pixabay.
