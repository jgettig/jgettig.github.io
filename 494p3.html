							<h3>About the game:</h3>
							<p>
								You are a reanimated skeleton trying to live a normal life, but the members of the nearby town want to seal you
								away! Luckily you have a trick up your humerus: a gun. Defend your graveyard in this low fantasy roguelike bullet
								hell by fighting off townsfolk and stopping their sorcerers from lighting the three altars that will imprison you in
								your coffin for the rest of time.
							</p>

							<h3>About the project:</h3>
							<p>
								This project is the culmination of everything we learned in the class throughout the semester. Over the course of
								six weeks, groups of four and five were tasked with creating a game or complete demo that would be shown at a final showcase. Submissions
								are graded based on their quality as a game, their technical complexity, and how understandable they are to players new to the game.
							</p>
							
							<h3>My Contributions:</h3>

							<p>Work was done in collaboration with:</p>
							<a href=" https://cowlesg.github.io/">Gregory Cowles</a>
							<a href="https://calebgif.github.io/">Caleb Gifford</a>
							<a href=" https://eschoep.github.io/">Ezra Schoeplein</a>
							<a href=" https://xia-steven.github.io/">Steven Xia</a>

							<p>
								Due to the sheer scope of the project, all group members did significant work on many systems in the game, especially the enemy, weapon, and power-up systems. However, I did the majority
								of the work on the main game control, enemy spawning, and gun/ammo UI systems. I also did significant work on the health UI, which was eventually refactored into its final iteration by Gregory,
								and I adapted a spritesheet we obtained to create the map's floor textures. There were also two systems I worked on that are not readily visible to the player. First, I created the base code behind
								Haunt's power-up system as well as the initial implementations of a couple power-ups. Second, I created a framework that allows us to store gameplay parameters such as night length and enemy data in
								JSON config files. This allowed us to agregate all of these parameters in a single place rather than spreading them out across dozens of scripts and has the added bonus of letting us change these
								parameters without having to rebuild the entire project.
							</p>

							<h3>Technology/Tools Used:</h3>
							<p>
								This project created in Unity and coded in C#. This was easily our largest and most complicated game dev experience. We used Atlassian's Jira software for project management, and specifically
								made use of their burndown charts to guage how well we were avoiding burnout. We also used various other tools, such as GitHub for version control and Photoshop and Aseprite for spritesheet editing. 
								Much of our art was sourced from opengameart.org.
