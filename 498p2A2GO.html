        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
            This project saw groups create a Pokemon GO!-inspired augmented reality game in which users can explore Ann Arbor, plant trees to gain currency which can be used
            to buy new seeds, and defend their trees from squirrel attacks.

        <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
        <p>Work was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.johnfav.me">John Favret</a>.</p>
        <p> 
            Much of my initial work on this project was centered around creating the seed inventory interface and some basic frameworks for tracking the seed types, their costs, whether they are unlocked, and
            how many of each seed the player owns. Later on, I created a similar system for tracking planted trees and negotiating the trees' locations in the AR view and the map view. Finally, I created the squirrel
            attack system, the acorn throwing system the player uses to defend against squirrels, and the boss system. I also spent a significant amount of time on bug fixes such as correcting the compass's orientation
            and the orbit camera system's calculations.

        <h3>Technology/Tools Used:</h3>
        <p>
            This project created in Unity using its ARKit package as well as the Mapbox Unity SDK, and was coded in C#. This was our first ever AR project. For project
            management, we utilized Atlassian's Jira software, specifically its story point system. Version control was mantained through GitHub. Additionally, this project
            required the use of assets whose creation is beyond the scope of the class. Most models were obtained from Sketchfab, animations from Mixamo, images from Pexels, 
            and audio from freesound.org and opengameart.org.
