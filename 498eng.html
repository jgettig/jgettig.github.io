        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
            This project is the culmination of the semester's work, in which we took our uniform engines and added our own unique features to them. My chosen feature was integration with the Tiled map editor, which allows for much <br/>
            easier editing than directly manipulating JSON text. While my product succeeded at making level editing easier, it still has room for improvement by more seamlessly integrating actor modification into the interface.<br/>
            In the future, I intend to continue working on this project, at least until the Tiled editor is functional enough to use to make a non-trivial game.

        <h3>Technology/Tools Used:</h3>
        <p>
            This project created in C++ using 3rd party libraries such as Lua, LuaBridge, GLM, SDL, Box2d, Tiled, and RapidJSON. With the exception of a few course headers, and the aforementioned libraries, all of the project's source code
            is wholly my creation.
