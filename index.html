            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a junior at the university of Michigan, Ann Arbor pursuing a dual major in computer science and computer engineering.
                <br><br>
                One of my greatest areas of interest is video game design and development. I am an active member in the university's game 
                development club, WolverineSoft, and participate in the club's regular game jams.
                <br><br>
                Beyond making games, my areas of academic interest include computer vision, machine learning, software engineering, compiler
                design, OS design, and embedded systems.
                <br><br>
                Outside of school, I enjoy playing games, whether they be video games, board games, or table-top roleplaying games. I am also 
                very interested in space and rocketry, and follow developments in that sphere quite closely.

            <h3>EECS 494:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development</strong> is an upper level computer science capstone course at the University of Michigan. It's stated
                goal is to give students enough familiarity and experience with development concepts and environments in one semester that they can be 
                competitive with students who have had multiple years of game development education. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The class teaches important concepts from the basics of Unity and C# programming to more in-depth design patterns such as the observer pattern
                and event bus Pub/Sub. Learned skills are put to the test through three major projects. First is a retro game recreation, second is a shorter,
                design-oriented project, and third is a longer, more in-depth project, where large groups create and realize fully fledged, albeit small, games.
                More information about each project is/will be available on its page below.

            <p>
                <strong>EECS 498: Extended Reality and Society</strong> is an upper level computer science capstone course at the University of Michigan. It's is a
                sister class to EECS 494 in that it covers topics related to, but distinct from its counterpart. As the name suggests, this class focuses on learning
                the development environments associated with augmented and virtual reality. The class also distinguishes itself from EECS 494 in that it teaches Unreal
                engine for VR along with Unity for AR, allowing students to gain experience in multiple different engines.
                <br>
                <br>
                EECS 498 is, similarly to 494, separated into three projects. First is a wholly VR project in which teams must recreate a beloved room from the university's
                Bob and Betty Beyster Building. Second is a wholly AR project in which teams create an app inspired by Pokemon GO. The final project, similarly to 494, is
                much larger in scope, but in this class, students must make an XR game or app that is more than just a video game. As above, more info is/will be available on
                the individual project pages below.
